# Hosts
Hosts are collections of [modules](../modules/info.md) with a specific device type and work in mind, ranging from development to art.

## Installation
All hosts start out as a bootstrap, which contains the bare minimum required to fetch and set up modules from this repository. Please refer to the [bootstrap installation guide](bootstrap/bootstrap-installation-guide.md), which will walk you through disk partitioning, encryption, and loading a basic `configuration.nix`.
